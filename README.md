> "We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit." — Aristotle

Welcome to my structured **Data Structures & Algorithms mastery repository**, where I document my journey toward becoming a high-level software engineer ready for top technical interviews.

This is not a random collection of solved problems — it is a **deliberate system designed to build deep algorithmic intuition.**

---

# 🎯 Mission

To master problem-solving to the level where I can:

✅ Break down complex problems quickly  
✅ Identify hidden patterns  
✅ Write optimal code under pressure  
✅ Design efficient solutions  
✅ Perform strongly in technical interviews  

---

# 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

Most candidates practice inconsistently.

Most forget what they solve.

Most cannot explain their approach.

I refuse to be “most candidates.”

This repository enforces:

- Structured learning  
- Pattern recognition  
- Deep understanding  
- Relentless consistency  

---

# ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Primary Language:** `Java`

Why Java?

✔ Powerful and verbose enough for clarity  
✔ Excellent for Data Structures  
✔ Widely accepted in interviews  
✔ Strong OOP foundation

# 🔥 Problem Solving Philosophy

My approach follows a strict hierarchy:

### 1️⃣ Understand the brute force  
### 2️⃣ Identify the bottleneck  
### 3️⃣ Optimize intelligently  
### 4️⃣ Analyze complexity  
### 5️⃣ Write clean, production-style code  

> Great engineers optimize thinking before code.

# 🧩 Interview Pattern Library

One of the biggest mistakes candidates make is solving problems without extracting patterns.

To avoid that, I maintain a dedicated:

👉 **InterviewPatterns/** directory  

Containing reusable mental models for:

- Sliding Window  
- Binary Search  
- DFS / BFS  
- Dynamic Programming  
- Two Pointers  
- Greedy  

This transforms preparation from **problem memorization → pattern mastery.**

---

# 🏆 Problem Sources

Problems are curated from high-quality platforms:

- LeetCode  
- GeeksforGeeks  
- Codeforces  
- Interview archives  

Priority is given to **frequently asked interview questions.**

---

# 📅 Consistency Rule

I believe consistency beats talent.

**Daily Target:**  
👉 Solve 2–5 problems  
👉 Focus on understanding, not speed  

Because algorithmic strength compounds over time.

# ⭐ What Makes This Repository Different?

Many repositories show activity.

Few demonstrate engineering maturity.

Each solution in this repo includes:

✅ Approach explanation  
✅ Complexity analysis  
✅ Clean formatting  
✅ Meaningful variable names  
✅ Interview-ready logic  

No shortcuts. No copy-paste.

---

# 🚀 Long-Term Vision

This repository is part of a larger roadmap toward:

- Becoming an exceptional software engineer  
- Building distributed systems  
- Mastering system design  
- Contributing to impactful technology  

This is not a 3-month sprint.

It is a professional transformation.
